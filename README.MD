# sybil-process-manager
as of right now, I've only got the basic framework layed out for this.
heck I haven't even written any actual classes, just test classes to ensure the CMake scripts work.
in time, however, it will become a fully fledged process manager.
this project will be entered in my local statewide TSA competition once it is finished.
